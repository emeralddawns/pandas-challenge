# pandas-challenge (Heroes of Pymoli)
This assignment consisted of using python pandas in Jupyter Notebook to work with a CSV file, perform an analysis, and output a summary analysis within Jupyter Notebook.  

# What the code does (in general terms)
The code opens the corresponding CSV, reads thru the data and calculates/creates any desired values, and displays them in data frames.

# What the code calculates
The **Heroes of Pymoli** code currently calculates and displays the following:

    The gender demographics of the data set and a purchasing summary broken down by gender

    The age demographics of the data set and a purchasing summary broken down by age
    
    The top five (5) spenders

    The top five (5) most popular items

    The top five (5) most profitable items

2) The group the spends the most, on average, belongs to the "Other/Nondisclosed" gender category (average: $4.56 per person), and is between 35-39 years of age (average:$4.76 per person). Female players come in second (average: $4.47 per person), and the second highest spending age group are players under 10 years old (average: $4.54 per person).

3) The item "Persuasion" is one of the third most popular items (with 9 sold), but is only 10th in profitability, owing to its relatively low price. "Persuasion" has made $28.99 in total, while "Nirvana" has made $44.10 and has also been purchased 9 times.
